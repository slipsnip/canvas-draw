# canvas-draw
Draw stuff on HTML5 Canvas

This is a playground that I am using to experiment with and learn Canvas API.  Goal is to see what it's capable of and how feasable a solution it is for me vs drawing stuff with CSS.  Very ugly, what is drawn will change over time as I play with new things.  This is also an experiment to see how easy it is for me to deploy a electron app and to learn some ES6, VSCode and Node.js at the same time.

## Debugging:

* Debug: "Electron: Main Process"
* Debug: "Electron: Renderer Process"
* Set breakpoint
* CTRL-R on Main Window / Problem Render Process

## Standard execution
npm start
